# Project: Advanced Network Analysis Tool

## Project Outline

### Setup Environment
- Configure your development environment with Python and necessary libraries.
- Install `scapy` for packet manipulation and analysis.
- Set up `curses` for creating a text-based user interface.

### Capture Network Packets
- Use `scapy` to capture and sniff network packets.
- Implement filters and conditions for specific packet types or protocols.

### Analyze Network Packets
- Process captured packets for analysis.
- Extract relevant information such as source/destination addresses, protocols, and payload data.
- Implement algorithms or rules to detect anomalies or patterns in network traffic.

### Create a Text-based User Interface
- Develop a user interface using `curses` to display captured packet data.
- Include features for real-time updates, filtering options, and interactive controls.
- Design the interface to be intuitive and user-friendly for network administrators and security analysts.

### Run and Display Tool with Custom Logo
- Integrate a custom logo or branding elements into the user interface.
- Ensure the tool runs smoothly, handling packet capture, analysis, and UI interactions seamlessly.
- Provide clear instructions for running the tool and customizing settings.

**Note:** Advanced network analysis tools should be used responsibly and in compliance with legal and ethical guidelines. Ensure you have proper authorization before monitoring or analyzing network traffic.

**Disclaimer:** This project is for educational and research purposes only. Unauthorized monitoring of network traffic may violate privacy and security laws.
